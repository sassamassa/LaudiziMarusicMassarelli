\begin{abstract}
    This Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) is going to takle objectives, requirements (functional and non functional) for the project CodeKataBattles.
    
    It will be presented the scope, the functionalities and the domain of such project and we will give a comprehensive overview of the interaction with users and external components and the performance expected from the system.

    This document is going to be a reliable point of reference for developers since it will define clearly the functionalities of the system and it will give precise guidelines during the validation and verification process.

    The profound goal of this document is to give a precise overview of the product to be in order to give the stakeholders a general understanding of usage scenarios and avoiding changes of directions during the design and implementation part of the system development.

\section{Introduction} 
    \subsection{Purpose}
        This system allows students to boost their learning by participating in
        code challenges called kata battles organised by teachers and independent tutors.\\

        Such challenges will be part of tournaments so that it is possible for students to compete in multiple katas and seeing their position in a leaderbord of all participants.
        The system allows for the creator of the tournament to define a set of rules regarding the number of participants and the size of the groups of students and it gives the possibility to delegate the creation of the katas and the managing of the tournament also to other teachers.\\

        The system offers a platform integrated with GitHub where teachers can publish the kata and define the test cases that the code provided by the students must pass and assess student's submissions.
        The students on the other hand, can submit their code and see immediately
        its performances. The system assigns a score to each submission
        based on functional and non functional aspects of the code so that
        students can compare their work with other participants.\\
        
        Moreover, the system promotes global participation in kata battles, since it is possible to join battles organised by educators from all around the world.
        It is worth noticing that, not only certified teachers can create tournaments, but also independent tutors, allowing them to engage their students in productive competitions. 
        
            \subsubsection{Goals}
                The system must satisfy this goals:

                Actors definitions:
                \begin {itemize}
                    \item Admin: admins are the teachers, educators or tutors that created the tournament or were accepted by the creator as collaborators. Admin users have the previlege for that tournament to manage the tournament settings and parameters and to publish new kata battles
                    \item Participants: are the students that enroll in a tournament. 
                    \todo{better explain the subdivision in groups, maybe we don't have only the concept of participant but we have the concept of group and participants are the components of the group}
                \end {itemize}



                
                \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{G\arabic*}:]
                    \item Participants can participate in a tournament.
                    \item Participants can submit their code through GitHub.
                    \item Participants can view the results of their submission as a score from 0 to 100.
                    \item Participants can see the scores of other participants and their position in the leaderboard, whether they are in the same tournament or not.
                    \item Participants can see all tournaments currently running.
                    \item Admins can invite collaborators to the tournament that will be considered as admins once they accept the invite.
                    \item Users can request to become admins.
                    \item Admins can accept user requests to become admins.
                    \item Admins can accept user requests to participate in a tournament.
                    \item Admins and collaborators can create kata battles.
                    \item Admins can change the parameters for tournaments they created (e.g., make the tournament open, set the max number of participants, set the group size, set the duration of each kata battle).
                    \todo{Better define what the parameters are.}
                    \item Admins can...
                \end{enumerate}
                \todo {to be continued}

            \subsubsection{A°°°Create a Kata Battle}
                The system allows \admins to create a Kata Battle
                \todo {define a kata battle}. The process involves asking a
                textual description of the problem to solve by the \groups and a software project with build automation scripts whose structure depends on the programming language of choiche for the kata. This project must contain a set of test cases, otherwise it won't be possible to perform the evaluation of the submissions. 
                \todo {can katas allow for different programming languages?}.
                After that the sytem prompts for some configurations parameters for the kata, such as minimum and maximum number of students per group, a registration deadline, a final submission deadline
                and additional configurations for scoring
                \todo {pay attention to the fact that scoring criterions are different based on the kata, so are not a property of the tournament}\\

                When the system receives in input the data required it performes some validity checks
                \todo{what are the necessary validity checks? what can't be validated and so has to be put in the constraints?}.
                 Later, it will ask for confirmation and the kata will be created.
                \todo{ Notifications will be sent?}
                
            \subsubsection{A°°°Create Badge}
